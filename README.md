# Pilim

## Background

Pilim (pronounced "pill-im," named after the Korean pronunciation for "film") is a web app for casual movie viewers that I created for my third project at the Flatiron School. It utilizes Ruby on Rails, ActiveRecord, MVC framework, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to name a few.

Users can look for movie reviews or create personal lists of their favorite movies, movies to watch on a rainy day, movies for the heartbroken, etc. You can view it as a child between Rotten Tomatoes and Goodreads!

### Why?

In my free time, I regularly watch a lot of TV and movies. As a way to shift away from screens, I decided to go on Goodreads to see what books seemed interesting based on ones I've read in the past. From this, I realized that whenever I wanted to search for TV or movies similar to ones I enjoyed, I had to Google and mostly just found articles and blogs with titles such as "If you liked 'Stranger Things', watch these 10 movies!"

I wanted to create a website where users could both search for reviews as well as Goodreads-esque lists to explore other movies they'd possibly enjoy and hence, the birth of Pilim!

## Usage
